# Let's build a Robot
### This series is centered around a common Arduino Uno Robot kit. 
Most of this is based on a Mecanum wheel robot. There are lots of kits available and options to build your own. For uniformity all but the review section use the [HiWonder Miniauto kit](https://www.hiwonder.com/collections/arduino/products/miniauto).
## Review
- We are going to start with a little bit of a [review](https://github.com/dougnutz/hoc/tree/master/Robot/BasicControl)
. An alternative controller [example](https://github.com/dougnutz/hoc/tree/master/Robot/MotorControllerESP8266)
- Cheet [sheet](https://github.com/dougnutz/hoc/blob/master/Robot/Review.md)  
## Motion Control
- Mecanum wheel robot [basics](https://github.com/dougnutz/hoc/tree/master/Robot/MotionControlBasics)
- More advanced [movement](https://github.com/dougnutz/hoc/tree/master/Robot/MotorDirectionAndTurns)
- Movement in [through an arc](https://github.com/dougnutz/hoc/tree/master/Robot/MotionInArc) 

## Sensor Control
- Using a sensor to [follow a line](https://github.com/dougnutz/hoc/blob/master/Robot/LineFollowing/Readme.md)
